The final project presentation as well as the python notebook itself is in "Final_Project".
Within "Final Project", all the working files including the datasets are in "Stock_Project".
In the Archive are old practice files.
I assume you found this file during the hiring process of a position I applied for, so if you have any questions please feel free to contact me at my email or phone number listed on my resume.

Thank You,
Zachary Wing
